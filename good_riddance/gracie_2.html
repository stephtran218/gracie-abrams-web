            This song is about a breakup that ended badly and it’s in the perspective of the person that was in it who is reminiscing and 
            regretting all the things that happened during that time. It is one of my favorite songs because it is highly emotional as you 
            can hear how raw and vulnerable Gracie Abram’s vocals are, which elevates the sadness displayed lyrically and musically. What 
            makes this song special is that you can feel the pain and hurt that she feels as she sings the song, making you imagine as if 
            you were part of the relationship as well.

            Mess It Up is a song about emotional attachment and one’s self-awareness on their issues in the hopes of resolving them to 
            salvage their relationship. I like this song because the lyrics and the beat makes the song sound like it’s from two 
            perspectives but from the same person. One perspective is optimistic and hopeful that they could restore their relationship 
            and be happy again, which represents the future version of themselves. The other is recognizing their faults and begging for 
            forgiveness, which represents the current version of themselves.

            This song focuses on a different type of relationship, a friendship. It highlights the beauty and how special friendships are 
            when they are with the right person during the right time. It’s about those friendships that you know will last a lifetime. 
            This song holds a special place in my heart as it reminds me how grateful I am to have such amazing friends and how we won’t 
            always be teenage girls forever. Especially during summer, this song was on blast as my friends and I went on our late-night 
            ice cream runs enjoying the cold summer air without a single worry about school and college apps.
